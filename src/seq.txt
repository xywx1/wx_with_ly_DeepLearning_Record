** Old Horse **

The old horse was a coachman, more than fifty years old, his thin cheeks engraved with the wind and frost of the years. His back was slightly stooped, as if he had been pulled for years. Every morning, before dawn, he pulled the old rickshaw out of the broken alley in the south of the city, the wheels creaked, like the sound of his bones rubbing.

The old horse's car was rented, and he had to pay two dollars a month. He scrimped and saved, thinking that one day he would have enough money to buy a car of his own. But this year, business is not good, rich people in the city are sitting on the car, rickshaw business is worse day by day. The old horse often waited at the corner of the street for half a day before a guest came and he earned a few coins.

That day, the old horse had a guest wearing a long gown. The guest wore gold glasses and held a thick book in his hand, looking down all the way. The old horse did not dare to ask more questions, but carefully pulled the car, for fear of jolting the guests. At the destination, the guest took out a piece of ocean and gave it to the old horse. The old horse was stunned. He had never seen such a generous guest in his life. His hand trembled as he thanked him.

The guest smiled and said, "Brother, your car is too old. It needs to be replaced." The old horse nodded, but his heart was bitter. He knew that changing cars was a distant dream for him.

That night, the old horse came home to a shabby house with only a plank bed and a lame table. He lay in bed with the ocean in his hand, thinking that if he saved a few more months, he might be able to buy a new car. He thought about it, the corners of his mouth slightly raised, as if he saw himself pulling the new car and walking in the street.

But the good times did not last long. After a few days, the old horse's wheels were broken. The repairman said that the car was beyond repair and had to be replaced. The old horse's heart sank, he knew that he had not saved enough money to buy a new car. He had to go back to the rental agency and rent an even worse car.

As the days passed, the old horse's back grew more and more bent, and the wrinkles on his face grew deeper and deeper. He still pulls a car every day, but the dream of buying a car seems to be farther and farther away. One day, while he was waiting for a customer at a street corner, he suddenly heard someone shout, "Old horse, where's your car?" He looked up and saw the guest with the gold glasses.

The old horse shook his head with a wry smile and said: "The car is broken and can't afford to rent a new one." The guest sighed, took a bill out of his pocket and handed it to the old horse: "Take it, buy a new car." The old horse was stunned. His hand trembled as he took the banknote, and tears flowed down unconsciously.

That night, the old horse finally bought a car of his own. Pulling his new car, he walked down the street, filled with satisfaction he had never had before. But he knew that this car, after all, was someone else's gift. His dreams are still far away.

The story of the old horse, like that old rickshaw, creaking, but always go to the end.
